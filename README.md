Implementation of parser of mathematical equations using LL(1) parser in C++.


# Quick overview

The program will provide the library for parsing general mathematical expressions, defining your own functions.

The parser will produce an AST that will support variables (i.e. you will be able to supply values to an AST so that it can produce value).

There will be also an optional UI for graph plotter and simple calculator.

The README.md will go into detail how the parser works and what you should know.


# Deadlines

The project is undefinitely postponed
